                    Hi! My name is Joshua Robinson, a computer science student at the University of Oklahoma. I'm a hardworking student who excels in various programming languages, including C++, java, javascript, python, and much more. I also excel in the areas of critical-thinking, teamwork, reliability, intelligence, creativity, and motivation. I am excited to have you here and hope you enjoy learning more about who I am. On the left is a button referencing all my programming and resume information. The right button directs you to the various website of my campus involvement. Finally, click the arrows to move the slides to learn where I come from. Enjoy!
                </p>
